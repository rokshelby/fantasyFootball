            <h5>Keeper League</h5>
            <p>Description:</p>
            Please vote on whether you would be interested in a keeper league for the 2026-2027 season. A keeper league allows you to retain a certain number of players from your current roster for the next season.
            At the moment, we are considering a keeper league format where each team can keep up to 1 player from their current roster.
            The way this would work would be that the player you keep would be able to be your keeper at that round in the next draft.
            For example, if you keep a player who was drafted in the 3rd round, you would be able to draft them in the 3rd round of the next draft.

            If you have any suggestions for improving this feature, please include them in the comments section below

            <h5>Waiver Wire System</h5>
            <p>Description:</p>
            Please vote on whether you would like to change the wavier wire system to a free agent budge system for the 2026-2027 season.
            The current waiver wire system allows for managers to only lose their waiver wire priority only if they use before waivers run. If a manager 
            waits for waivers to run, they will not lose their waiver wire priority.
            The proposed free agent budget system would allow managers to bid on free agents using a budget that
            is set at the beginning of the season. Each manager would have a budget of for example $100, and they would be able to bid on free agents using that budget.
            The highest bidder would win the player, and the amount bid would be deducted from their budget.
            This system would add an extra layer of strategy to the league, as managers would have to
            manage their budget throughout the season and decide how much to bid on players.
